You're welcome!
02-13-2023 07:43:37 PM | INFO | Dave: what does daemon means  what’s the difference with thread
02-13-2023 07:43:47 PM | INFO | Jarvis: 

Daemon is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user. It's usually initiated by the operating system and runs with low priority. Threads are parts of a process that can run independently of each other. They are typically used to improve the performance of the process by allowing multiple tasks to be executed concurrently.
02-13-2023 07:44:34 PM | INFO | Dave: so are daemon and thread essentially the same
02-13-2023 07:44:39 PM | INFO | Jarvis:  thing?

No, they are not the same thing. Daemon is a background process that runs without the direct control of an interactive user, while threads are parts of a process that can run independently of each other.
02-13-2023 07:45:26 PM | INFO | Dave: can you give me more context of the difference or an example if possible
02-13-2023 07:45:34 PM | INFO | Jarvis: 

A daemon is typically used to perform tasks in the background without interrupting the user. For example, a web server may run as a daemon to handle incoming requests. Threads, on the other hand, are used to allow different parts of a process to run concurrently, which can lead to improved performance. For example, a web browser may use multiple threads for different tasks such as loading images, downloading files, and running scripts in the background.

02-14-2023 10:34:04 AM | INFO | Dave: imagine you’re standing on the surface of the earth  you walk 1 mile south  1 mile west and then 1 mile north.  where are you now
02-14-2023 10:34:09 AM | INFO | Jarvis: ?

You would be back to your original starting point.
02-14-2023 10:34:39 AM | INFO | Dave: explain why that is  explain step by step
02-14-2023 10:34:45 AM | INFO | Jarvis: 

This is due to the effects of the earth's curvature. When you walk one mile south, you will be slightly closer to the equator, and one mile west will be further away from the equator. When you then walk one mile north, you will be travelling in a curved path back to your starting point. This is because the earth's surface is curved, and when you travel in a straight line, the earth's curvature will have an effect on your path.
02-14-2023 01:52:06 PM | INFO | Dave: anything else
02-14-2023 01:52:13 PM | INFO | Jarvis: 

If you wanted to end up at a completely different location, you would need to account for the earth's curvature and take a slightly curved route.
